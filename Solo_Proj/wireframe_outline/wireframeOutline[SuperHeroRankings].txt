New Programming Concept(s) I'm Planning to Learn: 

Week 1 Features (to show at Review during Week 2)
- Sign up for a group (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x9PRE-xviP4N-jjPWlFNkNycPIzgeYyQKphdLFeaxGs/edit#gid=0)
- Schedule a Review during Week 2 (https://calendly.com/zpieper/solo-project-sprint)
- Create GitHub repo for project
- Create a .gitignore file for my project for my GitHub repo (enter in React, Python, or Java at https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore)
- Finish this completed txt file and create project wireframe using Balsamiq (https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) [Drawings and other wireframe programs also accepted!]
- Email Zack this completed txt file, and project wireframe for approval
- Submit completed wireframe on platform (https://login.codingdojo.com/m/97/6237/44911)
- Complete Arrays To Do 1 & Arrays To Do 2 assignments

- I'll need to learn an algo to sort the heroes in order of the fan rankings
- Implement a star rating system


Week 2 Features (to show at first office hour/lecture of Week 3)
- Schedule my time for my presentation (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x9PRE-xviP4N-jjPWlFNkNycPIzgeYyQKphdLFeaxGs/edit#gid=414986054)
- Begin to talk with group about project ideas and what skills I bring to the table
- Complete Singly Linked Lists Fronts & Display assignments
- ***Finish CSS work (could be Bootstrap or another framework too instead of CSS)***

- I'll need to learn Bootstrap or Tailwind in order to beautify the page.


Product Backlog (If I have more time after completing my MVP, I'll start to work on...)
- Maybe add likes and comments.
