Projects and Algorithms

This PnA (Projects and Algorithms) repo reflects my final Solo & Group assignments 
completed during my time enrolled in the Coding Dojo Bootcamp. This is the final 
course in CD's "Full-Stack" course curriculum which is taken only after completing the 
Python, Java & React <aka MERN> programming classes in their Full-Stack and is meant 
to be a culmination of everything learned in their Full-Stack. This is the final 
class before graduation from Coding Dojo Bootcamp.

The group project sub-folder is linked directly to our Movie_Quiz group repo.
